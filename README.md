# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to be a place where UT Bootcamp students store notes and toughts on the basic princples of web development. Building this application was challenging because I have zero experience in the field of web development. I learned what HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and README are and how to use them.
